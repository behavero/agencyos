# 2026-02-05 Session Notes

## Stats Not Loading (Root Cause Found)

**Problem:** Creators imported successfully (3 creators visible) but all stats showed 0. Console showed "No connected accounts in this agency. Connect the agency admin via OAuth first." for each creator.

**Root Cause:** The stats endpoint (`/api/creators/[id]/stats`) and transaction syncer only looked for tokens in the `models` table. But the agency OAuth token (from "Connect Fanvue") is stored in `agency_fanvue_connections` table. Imported creators don't have personal tokens.

**Fix:**

- `src/app/api/creators/[id]/stats/route.ts` -- Added `import { getAgencyFanvueToken }` and checks `agency_fanvue_connections` first, falls back to `models` table
- `src/lib/services/transaction-syncer.ts` -- Same fix in `getAgencyAdminToken()` function

Commit: `d68b013` - "fix: use agency_fanvue_connections token for stats & transaction sync"

## Live Auto-Refresh System

**Problem:** Stats only updated when user manually clicked "Refresh". Martin wants real-time live data.

**Solution:**

- Created `POST /api/creators/stats/refresh-all` -- bulk endpoint that refreshes all creators in parallel using agency token
- Updated `creator-management-client.tsx`:
  - Auto-refresh on mount if any creator has stats older than 2 minutes
  - Periodic background refresh every 60 seconds
  - "Refresh All" button now uses efficient bulk endpoint

Commit: `2c6b175` - "feat: live stats with auto-refresh and bulk stats API"

## Agent Infrastructure Audit

Reviewed the full agent setup (AGENTS.md, SOUL.md, USER.md, MEMORY.md, TOOLS.md, HEARTBEAT.md, .cursor/rules/, .cursor/agents/). Found:

- USER.md was empty
- MEMORY.md didn't exist
- TOOLS.md was generic template
- HEARTBEAT.md was empty
- .cursor/rules/onyxos.md was outdated (wrong token architecture, stale phase references, leaked secret value)
- .cursor/agents/ had report files mixed with agent definitions
- 30+ stale phase/status markdown files cluttering root

Proceeding with full cleanup and optimization.

## CRITICAL: Stats Wiped to Zero (Feb 6, continued session)

**Problem:** All model stats (revenue_total, subscribers_count, followers_count, posts_count, likes_count) were overwritten with 0. Revenue, subs, followers, posts, likes all zeroed across all 3 creators.

**Root Causes Found (3 separate issues):**

### 1. Stats Refresh writes 0s when API fails

The `/api/creators/stats/refresh-all` endpoint and Creator Management page (60-second auto-refresh) would overwrite model stats with 0 values when Fanvue API calls returned empty/failed data. No protection against writing zeros.

**Fix:** All stats-writing code now only updates fields with non-zero API data:

- `transaction-syncer.ts` `updateModelStats()` - only updates revenue if new total >= existing
- `cron/revenue-heartbeat` - same protection
- `stats/refresh-all` - only writes followers/subs if API call succeeded, only writes revenue if > 0

### 2. Token refresh window too aggressive (killed the connection)

`getAgencyFanvueToken()` used a 1-hour proactive refresh window, but Fanvue tokens last ~1 hour. This meant EVERY call triggered an unnecessary refresh attempt, burning through refresh tokens. The cron used a 2-hour window (same issue).

**Fix:**

- `getAgencyFanvueToken()`: refresh only when < 5 min remaining (was < 1 hour)
- Cron refresh window: 15 minutes (was 2 hours)

### 3. Sync returns "No creators found"

`GET /creators` API returned empty data. The Fanvue API error for individual creators was "Creator not found or not assigned to team member". Connection's `fanvue_user_id` matches Lanaa's UUID. Possible that the account needs specific agency admin role on Fanvue's side.

**Current DB State:**

- Olivia: $475.46 recovered from 481 transactions
- Lexi: $9.99 recovered from 1 transaction
- Lanaa: $0 (had no stored transactions - her $13,153 was from API stats only)
- All subs/followers/posts/likes still at 0 (API calls failing)
- Connection: expired (burned by premature refresh)

**Action Required:** User needs to reconnect Fanvue OAuth. After reconnecting, the new protection should prevent stats from being wiped again.
