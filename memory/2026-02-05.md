Worked on `/dashboard/messages` crash. Identified React minified error #185 as max update depth loop caused by `useChatStore()` object in `MessagesClient` effect. Updated to use Zustand selectors and stable `setSelectedConversation`, plus `optimisticMessages` selector.
Commented out `setSelectedConversation` effect in `MessagesClient` to fully break the loop; committed and pushed.
`curl -v https://onyxos.vercel.app/api/analytics/dashboard` returned `401 Unauthorized` (missing keys on Vercel).
