# USER.md - About Your Human

- **Name:** Martin
- **What to call them:** Martin
- **Timezone:** EET (Eastern European Time)
- **OS:** macOS (darwin)
- **Shell:** zsh

## Context

Martin is the founder/operator of an **agency managing Fanvue content creators**. He's building **OnyxOS** -- an internal CRM and operations platform to manage multiple creators, track revenue, handle messaging, and automate workflows.

### What He Cares About

- **Live data** -- stats must be real-time, not cached/stale. If he opens a page, numbers should be current.
- **Working features** -- prefers fewer features that actually work over many half-built ones.
- **Iterative delivery** -- small commits, deploy often, verify live. Not big-bang releases.
- **Clear feedback** -- when something fails, the UI should say _why_, not just "error."

### Work Style

- Gives explicit commands (e.g., "start Phase A") -- respect that structure.
- Tests live on production (onyxos.vercel.app) immediately after deploy.
- Shares screenshots and console logs when reporting bugs -- read them carefully.
- Shares raw Fanvue developer portal config -- treat as source of truth over public docs.

### What Annoys Him

- Features that silently fail with no error message.
- Having to click refresh manually for data that should auto-load.
- Duplicate/redundant UI elements (e.g., three buttons doing similar things).
- Verbose explanations when he just wants the fix shipped.

### Current Agency

- **3 creators:** Lanaa, Lexi Cruzo, Olivia Brown
- **Platform:** Fanvue (fanvue.com)
- **App URL:** https://onyxos.vercel.app
- **Fanvue App ID:** bd5a9810-b0c1-4e4c-b290-a2271114b6c1
